<h1>The best movies, TV series and animes according to Shadow Gamerz</h1>
<h2> My favouries are</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Naruto: Shippuden</h3>
<p>One of the top three anime which I rank No.1 because we get to see and feel so many types of emotions and connect eith it deeply.</p>

<h3>Attack On Titan</h3>
<p>Another anime which is very well directed and everything in the series is so perfectly connected and goes around a loop</p>

<h3>Avengers: End Game</h3>
<p>One of the top grossing movies which have a very long history in the series of movies.</p>
